###  INTRODUCTION

Patient Prime is a website to control patient prescription, we proposed a method of medical prescription system where doctor will suggest some generic medicine name and patient can view all medicine. 

Doctor will suggest generic names of medicines and the patient will get the prescription list by patient id. From the list it will show the current medicine type with price.

Doctor could easily login into our system and can easily Update the Patients Appointment.
